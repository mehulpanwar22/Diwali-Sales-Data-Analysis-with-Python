# Diwali-Sales-Analysis-With-Python

This repository contains the code and analysis for the Diwali Sales data analysis project. The project focuses on analyzing sales data during the Diwali festive season using Python's pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib libraries.


## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore and analyze the sales data during the Diwali season to gain insights and understand sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance. The analysis involves various data manipulation, data cleaning and visualization.


## Skills Demonstrated
- Python: The analysis was performed using Python programming language.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and aggregation.
- Seaborn: Utilized for creating visually appealing statistical visualizations.
- Matplotlib: Employed for creating customized plots and charts.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted thorough EDA to understand the data and uncover patterns.
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
- Data Visualization: Created meaningful plots to visually represent the data.

## Project Learnings
- Performed data cleaning and manipulation
- Peformed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
- Improved customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupation, gender and age groups.
- Improved sales by identifying most selling product categories and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet demands.
